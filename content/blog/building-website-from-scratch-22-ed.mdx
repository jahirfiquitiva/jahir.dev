## Intro

It's been a few months since I gave my website a design update. I've been noticing a few things I wanted
to change in my site since then and also considering some alternatives to the tech stack I had built
my website with.

This time I thought of using [Stitches](https://www.stitches.dev/) instead of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
to create styled components, I already had given it a try a couple months ago, but it had some issues, and
I think it was mostly because of how I wanted to build my components and make them extend from one another,
which caused a lot of dependency.

That's also another reason why I decided to build the website from scratch. I think they way I created and
organized components before was not the best and caused it to be a bit complex to be updated or maintained.

## Same same, but different

Yeah, I didn't give the website a huge redesign, as there were just few things I thought needed improvement
in terms of UI. Instead, I tried to focus on writing less code but making it more useful, less dependent on
other components and organizing it a bit better, so that it could be easier to maintain, not just by me, but
anyone who would like to contribute to the project, as it's open-source.

That said, I didn't reduce the code in a huge amount, according to the pull request, the diff was
**`+11,615{:.fn}`¬†`‚àí12,326{:.key}`** so that's 711 lines of code less. Anyway, I added more features and content
to different pages that I'll mention later in this post, so I guess it was a win overall.

Let's go through the different components and pages updated. I like doing a side by side comparison
because it also helps me recognize and be aware of the improvements done. I hope you like them. üòÖ

Let's start with the site-wide components:

#### Content

I've reduced the content width to make everything even easier to read and more visually appealing
(in my opinion). I took reference from a few sites I really like, including [Lee Rob](https://leerob.io/):
`672px{:.num}` wide, [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/): `655px{:.num}`, [Delba](https://delba.dev/): `640px{:.num}`,
then aimed for the average which is `656px{:.num}`, but decided to go with the more _interesting_ value
of `666px{:.num}` üòÖüòà

#### Toolbar

Here I decided to not make it wider than the content, plus reducing the padding and spacing between links
a bit. Additionally changed the drop shadow for a glow-like one, which you'll also see in more components.

#### Footer

For this component, I decided to reposition the links, add a third column and move the social links to the
bottom right. Although it takes a bit more vertical space, I feel it looks more organized and clean now.

Also, as you can see, I added an item to show the song that I'm currently listening to on Spotify, and it even has
a cool animation while the song is playing.

  />
</video>

#### Focusable elements

I have added a great looking outline to all focusable elements, which include links, buttons, text inputs
and other few. This was based on the styles used by [Alistair Shepherd](https://alistairshepherd.uk/) and
I think/hope they improve the accessibility of my website.

    ![Button with focus

  </GridColumn>
</Grid>

## Pages

Time to go through the different pages:

#### About

This page was updated to not use so many emojis, make it easier to read. Plus I added a cool feed
with the latest 6 photos from my Instagram profile. It's made using the [Behold API](https://behold.so/);
let's hope it doesn't pass the rate limit ü§ûüòÖ

![Instagram Feed](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/insta-feed.png)

#### Blog post

The biggest change here are the share and edit actions. I've updated them to look like buttons, plus the
share option will use the native [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API)
if it's available, which brings up more options of sites to share the content, instead of limiting it to
just Twitter.

#### Contact

For this one, I kept it simple and just updated the layout of the different links to kind of look like a table.

[![Contact page links and content](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/contact-page.png)](/contact)

#### Uses

Probably the one that I changed the most, and also one of my favorites. It now includes a [photo](/uses) of my actual
in-real-life setup.

Added a grid showing images of the different hardware I use.

[![Grid showing different hardware tools](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/hardware.png)](/uses)

Added another grid showing some of my favorite and most used apps on my MacBook

[![Grid showing different MacOS apps](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/apps.png)](/uses)

And finally, a cool simple section showcasing the different tools in the stack I used to build this website:

View all these changes at [/uses](/uses)

#### Donate

This page also changed a lot, I wanted a better way to list my sponsors, plus also add some content aiming to
encourage more people to sponsor me.

[![Partially visible table listing my sponsors](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/sponsors.png)](/donate)

This is part of the new sponsors list or table.

I included some stats for transparency, so everyone can know how many sponsors I have and how much I earn per
month from them, and last but not least, some testimonials from previous sponsors.

#### Inspiration

For this page, I decided to go with a simpler design, making items smaller so more content can fit in the
same space. And I also fixed some favicons that were not loading, and replaced them with default avatars
from [Boring Avatars](https://boringavatars.com).

#### Dashboard

This one also received a big change for the stats specifically. I added colorful icons and cards, and even
more stats.

#### The rest

The other pages might not have changed much visually, but they do have a few updates in terms of margin,
padding, icons, colors and more.

You can view the previous website at [v10.jahir.dev](https://v10.jahir.dev) and check the differences üòÖ

## Database Updates

Additionally, I moved from [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) to [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=Ri5XbE) for hosting
the database that has the reactions and views records. The reason is I found Railway which supports many
different types of projects. I already deployed 5 that are built with NodeJS and Python, and it was a great
and pretty straightforward experience.

Those projects were previously deployed to Heroku but they would be ‚Äúput to sleep‚Äù if not used for a while,
while in [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=Ri5XbE) they stay alive, and I'm only charged based on
their usage, plus they offer $5 quota for free every month.

![Railway database usage stats](/media/blog/building-website-scratch-22/railway-usage.png)

Although the database is the one that costs the most üò¨¬†, the other projects don't cost more than $0,65 each,
but I'm getting closer to the limit‚Ä¶ If you'd like to help me out with those costs, you can follow this
referral link for [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=Ri5XbE), or even [sponsor me](/donate).
Thanks in advance!

> **Update:**
> I moved back to [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).<br/>
> At least for a MySQL instance, I think [Railway](https://railway.app/?referralCode=Ri5XbE) is really expensive.
> My database was just one table with about 12 rows,
> and the pricing rapidly went from $3.52 to $7.82 in less than 1 month.<br/>
> I still recommend it for node or python backend projects though, as the pricing is much more reasonable and you might not
> exceed the free quota so quick.

## Improved performance

After all these updates, the website has scored 100 points in performance, accessibility, best practices and search
engine optimization based on LightHouse tests.

## What's next?

At this time, I don't really have plans to start from scratch for my website üòÖ¬†It definitely takes a lot of time and effort.
Anyway, now I'm much more happy with the tech stack, the project structure and the design, so I hope that future updates
are much easier to work on.
