In life, we come across many people who leave a lasting impression on us. Some inspire us with their achievements, while others motivate us with their resilience and determination, and eventually become a reference for what we aim for.

In this blog post, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate some of the people who have had a significant impact on me, motivating me to be a better version of myself.

As Austin Kleon mentions in his book “[Steal like an artist](https://austinkleon.com/steal/)”: we are the sum of our influences.

## People that inspire me

This is a short list of people I truly admire, because they are great persons, constantly share knowledge and help others learn and grow, create amazing projects, many of them in the open (open-source) and do things that I can just hope to be able to do one day.
