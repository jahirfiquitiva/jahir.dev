### Introduction

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are both useful tools to keep your code clean and to enforce a standard coding style in your projects.

They both provide some rules and formatting to achieve that, and they work fine when separate, but together, it can be tricky to make them work correctly.

### The problem

I recently came across a small but slightly annoying issue with my development workflow, specifically while working on an update for my personal website, but also working on a client project and switching between the two projects during the day.

Both were TypeScript and React projects. The client project had defined rules for `ESLint` to work with `Prettier`, although it didn't include a specific `.prettierrc` file.

### The findings

Eventually, I found my workflow requiring two steps when formatting files in VS Code: format with `ESLint` and then format with `Prettier`. Each option applied different changes, but using both just made my code look the way I wanted it to.

So, I double checked the configuration in the client project, as it was not necessary to use both formatters in it, and it worked just fine with just `ESLint`.

Here's the changes done in order to get both `ESLint` and `Prettier` working together, with a single formatter:

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn add -D eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier
   ```

   These dependencies are for development only, so that's why they're installed with the `-D` flag.

2. Update your config file to use the plugin

   ```json title=".eslintrc | .eslintrc.json" {4,9}
   {
     "extends": [
       ...
       "plugin:prettier/recommended"
     ],
     ...
     "plugins": [
       ...
       "prettier"
     ],
     ...
   }
   ```

3. 🎉 Enjoy!

### Conclusion

After doing these changes I can finally format my code with a single formatter (`ESLint`) but applying the rules from both `ESLint` and `Prettier`, which was exactly what I was looking for.

If it does not work right away, try restarting the TypeScript server from VS Code's command palette or restart VS Code.
